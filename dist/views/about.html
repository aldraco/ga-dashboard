<h1>About</h1> <p>Thanks for looking at my data dashboard project.</p> <p>The goal of this project was to display my skills using Angular. There are a few things to note:</p> <ul> <li>Test Coverage: </li> <li>Mobile Friendly</li> <li>Descriptive analytics: the dashboard tells you in English what to pay attention to.</li> </ul> <h3>Where to go from here</h3> <p>I always end a project or task by asking myself what the next thing to learn should be. Here are a few of my thoughts after this project.</p> <ul> <h4>Further Study</h4> <li>Angular unit and e2e testing</li> <li>Chart js</li> <h4>New Topics</h4> <li>D3.js</li> </ul>
